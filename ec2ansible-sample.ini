# API calls to EC2 are slow. For this reason, we cache the results of an API
# call. Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to. Two files
# will be written to this directory:
#   - ansible-ec2.cache
#   - ansible-ec2.index

# Instance filters can be used to control which instances are retrieved for
# inventory. For the full list of possible filters, please read the EC2 API
# docs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeInstances.html#query-DescribeInstances-filters
# Filters are key/value pairs separated by '=', to list multiple filters use
# a list separated by commas. See examples below.

# Retrieve only instances with (key=value) env=stage tag
# instance_filters = tag:env=stage

# Retrieve only instances with role=webservers OR role=dbservers tag
# instance_filters = tag:role=webservers,tag:role=dbservers

# Retrieve only t1.micro instances OR instances with tag env=stage
# instance_filters = instance-type=t1.micro,tag:env=stage

# You can use wildcards in filter values also. Below will list instances which
# tag Name value matches webservers1*
# (ex. webservers15, webservers1a, webservers123 etc)
# instance_filters = tag:Name=webservers1*
